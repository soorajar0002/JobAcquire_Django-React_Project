              this situation at least once in our careers: You spend days upon
              days going through job ads, hours upon hours tweaking your resume
              to fit each position, prepare to attend countless interviews and
              then… nothing. You’re back right at the beginning of the cycle,
              going through more job ads and wondering if you’ll ever get out of
              this loop. Chances are that right now, there’s something missing
              in your job-search process. Maybe your resume isn’t ATS-friendly
              and never made it to a recruiter’s hands. Or maybe you’re not
              looking for ads in the right places. Whatever it might be, we’ll

              <h1 className="fo">#1. Identify Your Career Goals</h1>
              <p className="font-light text-xl mt-4">
                Before beginning your job search, especially if you’re a recent
                graduate or you’re changing careers, you need to sort out your
                career goals and narrow down your search. If you’re just looking
                for any random job, you won’t even know where to start your
                search from. Instead, ask yourself: What industry am I aiming
                for? What specific position? Do I have a dream job? If yes, what
                steps do I need to take in order to get there? Asking these
                questions will help you figure out what exactly it is that
                you’re looking for.

              <h1>#2. Dedicate Time to the Search</h1>
              <p className="font-light text-xl mt-4">
                Looking for a job is not a part-time engagement or a weekend
                activity. You need to be constantly on the lookout. Schedule a
                number of hours/day or some specific days/week that you will
                dedicate to your job search and don’t stop until you have a few
                interviews lined up. Alternatively, you can also set a goal to
                apply for 10 - 20 jobs on a daily basis. If you do not have
                enough free time, you can use tools such as LoopCV that
                automates your job application process by collecting millions of
                job postings, matching your profile, and applies on your behalf.
                They do this in 4 easy steps:
                <li className="mt-4">
                  Upload your CV and define your job preferences
                </li>
                <li>Create one or more job searches (Loops)</li>
                <li>
                  LoopCV will search for matches and alert you immediately
                </li>

              <h1> #3. Don’t Limit Your Search to Online Resources</h1>
              <p className="font-light text-xl mt-4">
                Social media has been revolutionary. As of 73% of young adults
                claimed they found a job through a social media website. That’s
                a lot! However, it doesn’t mean you should close the door on
                other opportunities. Attend job fairs, reach out to hiring
                managers, or use a career counseling service. Nothing bad can
                come out of expanding opportunities and taking advantage of all
                job search options. #4. Make

              <h1> #4. Make Networking Part of Your Everyday Life</h1>
              <p className="font-light text-xl mt-4">
                Some positions get filled internally or through networking,
                without ever being published. In fact, some experts say between
                70-85% of people found their jobs through networking, and it
                makes sense. Companies are more likely to hire someone that
                comes with a recommendation from a trusted source than someone
                they found on the internet. Networking is becoming one of the
                most efficient ways to finding a job and you should take
                advantage of that. Get out there, have face to face
                conversations with people, build connections and strengthen
                already existing ones. Make sure they know where you currently
                are professionally and where you aim to go, and learn the same
                about them as well. Rather than a task, you should look at
                networking as a way of living.

              <h1>#5. Keep Yourself Busy</h1>
              <p className="font-light text-xl mt-4">
                While you’re looking for a job, you can invest some of your time
                in improving yourself. You can take an online course, volunteer,
                or do an internship related to the position/industry you are
                trying to get into. This will not only be a great way to expand
                your network of contacts, but it will also give you something
                new to add to your resume, and that’s always a plus.

              <h1>#6. Optimize Your LinkedIn Profile</h1>
              <p className="font-light text-xl mt-4">
                Apart from being a great platform for networking and connecting
                with other professionals, LinkedIn is also a key tool in
                searching for and finding a job. Did you know that every 7
                seconds, someone gets hired through LinkedIn? That’s crazy! So,
                what this means is that you should view your profile not only as
                a social media profile, but also as a resume of a kind. Best
                case scenario, you’ll have recruiters reaching out and inviting
                YOU for jobs, not the other way around!

              <p className="font-light text-xl mt-4">
                Employment is a two-way thing: You need to be the right fit for
                the company, but the company needs to be the right fit for you
                as well. When searching for positions to apply for, don’t just
                go for whatever is available. Do your research and look into the
                company, their values, salaries etc. If the company is not a
                good match, you’ll have spared both you and them the time. You
                can learn more about potential employers through Glassdoor,
                where you can read company reviews, check salary ranges, and
                more.
